%% A simple moving average (SMA) strategy
% 
% Finally, it is important to remember that any strategy we use has to be formulated 
% by considering only the previous price values of each tick. This means, that 
% no future price value can be known beforehand, and as we're considering the 
% close price of each tick, the current index is unknown until the tick ends, 
% or the new one starts. As an example, a simple strategy can be formulated 
% using the Moving Average (MA), which calculates the average price over a 
% certain window length $L$ of ticks, filtering the signal into a smoother 
% representation. A possible rule for this strategy is to buy every time the 
% tick close price cross over the MA line, and sell when it cross under it. 
% A simple moving average (SMA) strategy can be implemented as follows:
% ${MA}_{i}(L) = \frac{\sum_{j=i-L}^{i}{close_j}}{L}$
% ${MA}^{Strategy}_{i}(L) =$ 
% $\begin{cases} 0 \quad i < L | 1 \quad {MA}_{i-1}(L) > close_{i-1} | -1 \quad otherwise \end{cases}$
% $\begin{array}{@{}ll@{}} 0 \quad i < L \\ 1 \quad {MA}_{i-1}(L) > close_{i-1} \\  \end{array}$
% $x^2+e^{\pi i}$
